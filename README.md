# **Pendle: SRISSS, a Stress Reduction Information System Software Solution**
### **Combining Computer Vision with Bilateral Stimulation to Reduce Stress.**

#### **Computer Vision:**
 - Pendle will monitor and record your heart rate, breathing, and emotions.
#### **Bilateral Stimulation:**
 - Pendle uses a swinging ball, inspired by Eye-Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy, to help you process your experiences while feeling calm and relaxed.
#### **Relaxation Session:**
 - Stay focused and follow the moving object and instructions on your screen, like taking a deep breath.
